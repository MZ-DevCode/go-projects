# Go Development & Systems Research 🚀

This repository serves as a comprehensive workspace for Go development, covering fundamental algorithms, concurrent networking tools, and embedded systems programming. The projects within demonstrate a transition from basic logic to high-performance system utilities.

## 📁 Repository Overview

The codebase is structured to showcase various aspects of the Go ecosystem:
- **Networking & Security**: Multi-threaded tools designed for rapid network reconnaissance and socket manipulation.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Optimized implementations of string processing (Unicode/Rune), sorting, and search patterns.
- **Terminal Applications**: Lightweight CLI tools built for efficiency and direct user interaction.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/MZ-DevCode/go-projects/...
```
```
cd go-projects
```
### 2. Local Execution
To run any algorithm or tool on your host machine:
```
go run path/to/project.go
```
